"""
A failed OpenAI synthesis must answer with an ERROR reply, not an audio file.

``OpenaiVoice.textToVoice`` never inspected ``response.status_code``, so on a
401/429/5xx OpenAI's JSON error envelope was written verbatim into a file named
``*.mp3`` and returned as a *successful* ``ReplyType.VOICE`` -- the user got a
voice bubble that silently refuses to play while the log says
``text_to_Voice success``.

Every sibling already checks: ``voice/custom/custom_voice.py`` checks it before
building the file name, ``voice/mimo/mimo_voice.py`` and ``voice/linkai`` return
an ERROR reply, and ``OpenaiVoice.voiceToText`` in this very module does both.
These tests pin the missing check, and pin that a failed request leaves no junk
``.mp3`` behind.
