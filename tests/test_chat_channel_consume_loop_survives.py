"""The shared consume loop must survive one bad session.

``ChatChannel.consume`` is the message pump every channel subclass starts in
``__init__``, and its ``while True`` body is bare: any exception raised while
looking at a session unwinds out of the loop and kills the pump for the rest of
the process lifetime. Messages then pile up in the per-session queues and the
bot goes silent, while the process itself stays up and nothing in the log names
the cause.

Two ways to raise in there today:

* the ``assert len(self.futures[session_id]) == 0`` guard -- an ``assert`` used
  for a runtime check, which also vanishes under ``python -O``;
* ``self.futures[session_id]`` is only created once a context is submitted, so
  an empty session whose semaphore looks drained raises ``KeyError`` first.
