"""The WeCom-app access-token refresh thread must survive a failed refresh.

``WechatComAppClient._active_refresh`` starts a single daemon thread that
re-reads the token every 60s and renews it 10 minutes before it expires. That
thread is the only thing keeping the token alive, and nothing inside its loop
catches anything: when ``fetch_access_token`` raises -- a DNS blip, a gateway
500, an invalid ``secret`` -- the exception unwinds out of ``refresh_loop`` and
the thread dies for the rest of the process lifetime. The token then expires
(WeCom hands out 2h tokens) and every later call fails until CowAgent is
restarted, with no error pointing at the real cause.
