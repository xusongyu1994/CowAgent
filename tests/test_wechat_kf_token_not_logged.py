"""A failed kf API call must not write the access token into run.log.

Both WeCom kf endpoints take the token as a query parameter:

    url = f"{KF_API_BASE}/sync_msg?access_token={self.client.access_token}"

and requests puts the whole URL, query included, into the message of the
exception it raises when the call fails -- ``Max retries exceeded with url:
/cgi-bin/kf/sync_msg?access_token=...``. Logging that exception raw therefore
writes a live credential into run.log, which the web console serves as a
complete file download (``LogsDownloadHandler``). A single network blip is
enough to leak it. The same URLs were scrubbed in the wechatcom and dingtalk
channels; wechat_kf was missed.
