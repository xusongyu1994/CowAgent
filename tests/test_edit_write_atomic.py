"""The edit and write tools must not destroy a file they failed to write.

Both tools used `open(path, 'w')`, which truncates the target to zero bytes the
moment the handle opens. A failure after that point - a full disk, an EIO, a
virus scanner holding a lock, the process being killed - left the user with a
half-written or empty file while the tool only reported that the edit had
failed. Neither tool asks for confirmation first, so that failure is the user's
problem, not the agent's.

common.atomic_write already solves this by writing a dot-prefixed sibling and
renaming it over the target, and every other store in the repo uses it. These
tests pin the two file tools to the same guarantee, and pin the happy path so a
later "fix" cannot pass by refusing to write at all.

    The failure is injected at `f.write`, which both shapes of the tool call:
    the target itself when the tool opens it for truncation, and the sibling
    temp file once the tool writes atomically. So the tool genuinely hits ENOSPC
    either way and must report it - the only difference left between the two is
    whether the original file survives, which is the whole point.

    Not `os.replace`: atomic_write treats EBUSY/EXDEV/EACCES/EPERM from a rename
    as "this target can be written but not replaced" and falls back to truncating
    it in place, so a failure there would look like the bug it is meant to pin.
