"""
Regression tests for the search thresholds MemoryManager.search resolves.

`search` documents `max_results` / `min_score` as caller-supplied overrides and
resolves them with `x = x or self.config.x`, so an override of 0 — the value that
means "no threshold" and "return nothing" respectively — was indistinguishable
from "not supplied" and got silently replaced by the configured default. An Agent
asking `memory_search` for `min_score: 0` to see every weak match instead got the
0.1 default, so the low-scoring hits it specifically wanted were dropped with no
indication that a threshold had been applied.
