    """Remember recipient identities learned from accepted inbound messages.

    The store deliberately contains no access tokens or channel credentials.
    Channel implementations remain responsible for authentication and their
    normal outbound readiness checks.

    The directory is shared across Agents, but keyed by ``(instance_id, receiver)``
    rather than by ``(channel_type, receiver)``. A channel *type* can run several
    *instances* (two Feishu bots, two WeChat logins), each with its own login,
    tokens and — crucially — its own id space for receivers: the same receiver
    string on two WeChat instances is two different people. Delivery therefore has
    to go back out through the exact instance that first saw the contact, so the
    instance is part of the identity, not just the type.

    Legacy single-instance installs use ``instance_id == channel_type`` (that is
    how the launcher already synthesizes them), so an old entry saved under just a
    channel type keeps resolving unchanged.

    The owning Agent of a scheduled delivery is derived from the recipient's
    channel instance (an instance binds to one Agent), so it is not stored here.
